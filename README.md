# Welcome to my Python-Code repo! 
This is a collection of code I have wrote for either examples such as the using datetime, as its annoying to have to remember the syntax to everything

Also I have included things such as fizzbuzz.py which is a good problem solving peice of code as it makes you use multiple elements of python such as modulo and if 

I will publish more as I write it!
