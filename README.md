## Notes from the creator 
I have published this work as proof of knowledge as everything here has been programmed by me!

However, I will be adding more EXAMPLE pieces of code for everyone to use for either learning or when you have forgotten the syntax for each topic

I will add more comments to code if anyone needs help and finds my code examples hard to follow 

## Suggestions

I am always looking for helpful crititism with my code or just suggestions for more EXAMPLE pieces 

If you wish to add some comments, please use [this link](https://github.com/CleanMachine1/Python-Code/issues) and create an "issue"
